# MeLInterp

MeLInterp is an interpolation plugin for OTD which uses machine learning to upscale report rate to specified target.

Unlike hawku smoothing or devocub antichatter, MeLInterp have a concept of time for the interpolation itself and does not add any additional latency to the cursor except for the computation itself.
